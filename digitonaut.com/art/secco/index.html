<!--
"Secco" is a fresco painting technique in which pigments ground in water are tempered using egg yolk, or whole egg mixed with water, which are applied to plaster that has been moistened (using this temper) to simulate fresh plaster. No white is used (as in watercolour painting). In true fresco (buon fresco), the plaster is still fresh and has not dried when the watercolors are introduced.
